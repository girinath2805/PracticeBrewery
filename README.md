# Practice Brewery

Welcome to the **Practice Brewery**! üçª

This is where I keep all my practice code, little experiments, and random snippets. Think of it as a code playground, where the only rule is to have fun while learning!

In the **Sample Brewery**, you'll find an assortment of code concoctions brewed with love. Whether it's a tiny script that does something silly or a more serious experiment gone right (or wrong), it's all here. Perfect for when you need a break from the serious stuff or want to see what I've been tinkering with lately.
